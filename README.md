### Component Architecture and Reusability

Lost Legends is an immersive social web application tailored for metal detecting enthusiasts. It provides a platform for users to share their metal detecting adventures, explore new finds, and connect with like-minded individuals within the metal detecting community. The app's architecture is built on a framework of reusable components, ensuring efficient development and a seamless user experience across the platform.

#### Core Components
- The Asset component serves as a versatile tool within the application, responsible for managing the display of spinners or images alongside optional messages. Its functionality is utilized across multiple sections of the app, including NotFound, PostCreateForm, PostPage, PostsPage, PopularDetectorists, and DetectoristPage. By offering visual feedback during data loading and presenting specific images for informational purposes, the Asset component enhances the overall user experience and ensures smooth interaction throughout the platform.
- Avatar: This component displays user profile images. It's reused in the NavBar, Posts, Comments, and Detectorist sections to maintain consistency and personalization across the application.
- MoreDropdown: A general-purpose dropdown menu component reused in Comment, Post, and the Detectorist's profile page for various context-based actions.
- NavBar: A navigation bar component shown on all pages to ensure seamless navigation across the app.
- NotFound: A component shown when a requested resource is not found or a certain result does not exist.

#### Component Pages

- Authentication
  - LoginForm & SignupForm: Components handling user authentication processes.
- Comments
  - Comment: Used to display user comments.
  - CommentCreateForm & CommentEditForm: Forms used for creating and editing comments.
- Posts
  - Post: Component to display user posts.
  - PostCreateForm & PostEditForm: Forms used for creating and editing posts.
  - PostPage: Detailed view of a specific post.
  - PostsPage: List view of posts. It serves as the homepage, 'Following' page where posts by followed users are shown, 'Wishlistlist' page for displaying posts added to a user's wishlist and the 'Favorites' page for displaying posts added to a user's favorite list.

#### Detectorists

- PopularDetectorists: This component shows the most followed detectorists. It's displayed on the PostsPage for both mobile and desktop views, and on the PostPage for larger screens.
- Detectorist: Component to show user profile details.
- DetectoristEditForm: Form for editing user profile.
- DetectoristPage: Combines the Detectorist component with a list of that detectorist's posts.
- UsernameForm & UsernamePassword: Forms for changing username and password.

The use of the React library in the Lost Legends project has significantly contributed to enhancing the user experience. React's component-based architecture has helped create reusable components such as Asset, Avatar, MoreDropdown, NavBar, and others. These components not only ensure consistent look and feel across the application but also make the codebase more maintainable and easier to update or extend.

One particular feature where React has been instrumental is the implementation of infinite scrolling using the react-infinite-scroll-component. This feature greatly enhances user experience by loading data incrementally as the user scrolls, providing a seamless browsing experience without traditional pagination interruptions. Coupled with the axios library for asynchronous data fetching, the application is able to provide users with a non-blocking, smooth, and enjoyable browsing experience. The use of the react-router-dom also enhances navigation experience, allowing us to create a single-page application with multiple views that load instantly, providing a near-native user experience.



### Skeleton

#### Wireframes

The wireframes provide a visual representation of the different pages and features of the web application. They serve as a blueprint for the design and layout of each page, helping to visualize the user interface and overall user experience. These wireframes were created using Wireframe.cc, a tool that enables quick and intuitive sketching of design ideas.

### Design Choices

#### Colour
The design philosophy behind Lost Legends strikes a harmonious balance between minimalism and warmth, mirroring the exhilarating yet serene essence of metal detecting exploration. Embracing a clean aesthetic, the design prioritizes simplicity, allowing users to navigate effortlessly through the platform. Typography is carefully selected for readability, ensuring that users can easily engage with content and stories shared by fellow detectorists.

This minimalist approach fosters a serene atmosphere, inviting users to immerse themselves in the world of metal detecting.


#### Typography


In crafting the typography for this project, the chosen approach embraces system fonts for their versatility, readability, and cross-platform consistency. By utilizing a font stack that prioritizes system fonts such as "Segoe UI" on Windows, "Roboto" on Android, and "San Francisco" or "Helvetica Neue" on macOS, the design ensures a seamless experience across various devices and operating systems. This choice not only enhances readability but also aligns with modern design principles, offering a clean and familiar aesthetic that resonates with users. Additionally, leveraging system fonts contributes to faster loading times and reduces dependency on external font libraries, optimizing performance and accessibility. Overall, the decision to employ system fonts reflects a commitment to usability, accessibility, and a contemporary design ethos.
